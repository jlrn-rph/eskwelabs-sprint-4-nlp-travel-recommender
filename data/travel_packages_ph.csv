1,Visayas,Cebu,Snorkeling,Whale Shark Encounter and Sumilon Sandbar with Kawasan Falls,"An amazing experience. It was a very long day, 3.30am pick-up and then a 2hr+ hectic drive to Oslob. Long queues to buy whale shark tickets, but we got our tickets and then had time for our breakfast, that was basic but tasty. The WHALE shark experience was absolutely out of this world.   After a boat trip to Sumilon Sandbar (wasn't too impressed with this, way too many people on a tiny white beach), we visited the 1st of the 2 waterfalls. Tumalog was a very steep walk down a road, but so so beautiful. We took a bike back up. The hill is so steep, you can easily fall over. Last was Kawasan Falls - we were totally unprepared for this bit. It was amazing, but you need to prepare. It was about a 5kms walk along/through the river/pools and over rocks. Make sure you have good water shoes that are easy to walk in. Take your possessions (few) in a waterproof bag and take water, also money as there are a few vendors along the way. We were shattered after the walk, but it was an amazing experience. Next was the very long 2hr+ drive back. I would recommend that you actually stay for a night or 2 in the area to fully utilize all the activities in this area.",8922.98,4.5,83,6,https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/AttractionProductReview-g298460-d17460574-Whale_Shark_Encounter_and_Sumilon_Sandbar_with_Kawasan_Falls-Cebu_City_Cebu_Island.html,amazing experience long day 330am pickup 2hr hectic drive Oslob Long queues buy whale shark tickets got tickets time breakfast basic tasty WHALE shark experience absolutely world boat trip Sumilon Sandbar wasnt impressed way many people tiny white beach visited 1st 2 waterfalls Tumalog steep walk road beautiful took bike back hill steep easily fall Last Kawasan Falls totally unprepared bit amazing need prepare 5kms walk alongthrough riverpools rocks Make sure good water shoes easy walk Take possessions waterproof bag take water also money vendors along way shattered walk amazing experience Next long 2hr drive back would recommend actually stay night 2 area fully utilize activities area,Water Activities
2,Luzon,Metro Manila,Day Trips,Amazing Manila - Tagaytay Full Day Sightseeing Tour with transfers updated 2023,"Thanks again to the amazing staff Sean (Lead Tour Guide), Dan (Trainee Tour Guide), and Marvin (Driver) for the wonderful day. We had limited amount of time in Manila and had wanted to do a Day Trips while seeing a bit of Manila and this trip gave us all of that and more!We started the day in Manila in Intramuros (historic walled area). Good amount of history if that's what you're after and it felt like we were in Europe with the architecture.We then drove to Tagaytay. Views were fantastic. Since we were a private tour Sean suggested we take a boat ride to Taal! Sean really cared and ensured we got the most out of our day. Although I wish this was a bit more organized and the itinerary of options were more clearly outlined, but this ended up being the best part of the tour. The water was very calm, the boat ride was scenic, and the feeling of being so close to a live volcano was incredible. The experience was enriched by the stories of the locals (boat driver) and how their lives were impacted by the volcanic eruptions and how resilient people needed to be while still remaining inhabitants of the surrounding area. Also kudos to our driver Marvin for getting us everywhere on time. We had strict time deadlines and we got back exactly on time. Very much appreciated.Overall, if you want a taste of the city and nature with panoramic views then this is your trip.

21,Visayas,Cebu,Day Trips,Full-Day Moalboal Islands and Kawasan Falls Small-Group Tour from Cebu,"I have no complaints about the trip, I just think that having a guide and a driver was overkill and we probably therefore paid over the odds. The guide, lovely and polite as she was, added little to the experience as she actually slept more of the long journey than we did ourselves and didn't interact that much compared to other guides we have had. The driver on the other hand was an absolute star getting us there and back safely and in not too bad a time considering the distance/conditions/traffic. Unfortunately we couldn't do one of the islands due to rough water but the Sardine run was amazing to see. Wall to wall super shoals of sardines glimmering in the water, topped off with turtles too...and a few jelly fish, nothing too painful though.I do think they should start restricting numbers better as the area is full of boats coming and going with lots of none swimmers being towed around in the water with no control of their own. It felt a little like an accident waiting to happen. Kawasan falls is lovely, if a little underwhelming due to the crowds if I'm honest.Given it's massive build up I was just expecting something else, maybe we should have done the canyoning to get the full experience.

76,Luzon,Metro Manila,Day Trips,Pagsanjan Falls with side trip to Pililia Windmills of Rizal,"It was so cool! Trip from Manila is kind of long, i think its 2.5hrs away, but you see a lot and if you have a good tour guide for the ride, they educate you on things and its worth the drive. The actual trip to the waterfalls was really cool but mind blowing what these guys do to get you there. You start out in calm waters in a very skinny kayak. Youll have a guide in the front and back of you. They make their way up river paddling. But when you get to the rapids, these guys are nuts! they constantly half in and out of the kayak, Literally kicking on rocks and pulling you UP the rapids. It must have been so tiring. it was such an experience to see these guys do this. the falls itself was really cool once you get there, you get on a wooden raft and they just pull you into the small cave and then bring you back.

107,Visayas,Cebu,Boat Charters,Oslob Whaleshark with Sumilon Island,"I was in Cebu for work from late April to Mid-May. I took a one Day Trips to Oslob and Sumilon. I booked the tour with Southwind Travel and Tours. They pick up at hotel and bring you back. I was the only one on the trip so i had the guide, Rachel and the driver all to myself! They were both awesome.Cebu to Oslob is about 2.5 hours in the morning. You get there around 7am. Put on the life jacket and away you go. Six tourists to a boat. Two guides. They paddle you out to the Whaleshark feeding area, where a 'feeder' is throwing food over the sides of his canoe. The Whaleshark comes up, opens its huge mouth and inhales. You have stairs off the small boat to ease yourself into the water and you can swim right up to the Whaleshark, you cannot, or SHOULD NOT touch them. You can get pretty close as they just ignore you. It is an impressive creature! Good experience. Great for all ages. But keep in mind, ""Whaleshark Tourism"" is big business and there can be lots of people, I was lucky on the day i was there, it was only half packed i was told. Still when you look underwater you see scuba divers swimming around along with some pretty colorful fish. The whole experience last about 30 minutes. Water looks like its 30-40 feet deep and you are 50 yards from shore. There can be 10 or so people with you in the water at any given time. No everyone jumps in. You can take off the life jacket if you want.Then its onto Sumilon Island.Small Island, ten minute drive from Oslob. There is a small pier with a Tourist station (with bathroom) owned by the Bluewater Resort on Sumilon. Southwind Travel has an agreement with them to use the facilities. Its a 15 minutes boat ride to the Island. Great place. On the south side of the Island you have a sand bar with very gentle waves and very shallow water. Great for all ages. That is where most people hang out. I stayed practically all day on the north side where there is a marine preserve. Very nice snorkeling, lots of very colorful fish (some huge ones and some eel fish too) and sea life, including the odd 2.5 foot shark. The waves can be rough on this side. Lots of bolders, rocks. The tour included lunch at the Resort. It was a very good buffet I might add. The snorkeling beach has little tiki huts with elevated floors (no sand on your towels!!!!) and hammocks. You spend four hours or so there. Its not too busy, so you can just relax.Around 1:30 pm we headed home. Took the boat to shore. The ride home was close to 4 hours.All in all, a very great Day Trips and I could see myself staying a couple of days at the Bluewater Resort as it looked very nice.",6044.6,4.5,4,6,https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/AttractionProductReview-g294261-d12990388-Oslob_Whaleshark_with_Sumilon_Island-Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,Cebu work late April MidMay took one Day Trips Oslob Sumilon booked tour Southwind Travel Tours pick hotel bring back one trip guide Rachel driver awesomeCebu Oslob 25 hours morning get around 7am Put life jacket away go Six tourists boat Two guides paddle Whaleshark feeding area feeder throwing food sides canoe Whaleshark comes opens huge mouth inhales stairs small boat ease water swim right Whaleshark touch get pretty close ignore impressive creature Good experience Great ages keep mind Whaleshark Tourism big business lots people lucky day half packed told Still look underwater see scuba divers swimming around along pretty colorful fish whole experience last 30 minutes Water looks like 3040 feet deep 50 yards shore 10 people water given time everyone jumps take life jacket wantThen onto Sumilon IslandSmall Island ten minute drive Oslob small pier Tourist station bathroom owned Bluewater Resort Sumilon Southwind Travel agreement use facilities 15 minutes boat ride Island Great place south side Island sand bar gentle waves shallow water Great ages people hang stayed practically day north side marine preserve nice snorkeling lots colorful fish huge ones eel fish sea life including odd 25 foot shark waves rough side Lots bolders rocks tour included lunch Resort good buffet might add snorkeling beach little tiki huts elevated floors sand towels hammocks spend four hours busy relaxAround 130 pm headed home Took boat shore ride home close 4 hoursAll great Day Trips could see staying couple days Bluewater Resort looked nice,Water Activities

128,Visayas,Cebu,boat charters,Oslob Whale Shark Watching,"I want to say that any form of animal incarceration is unnatural but for many this is the only opportunity to witness these beautiful creatures close to their normal habitat.If you feel this is something you wish to do then at least let me offer some details of what is involved.The site is in Natalio Bacalso Avenue, Oslob. The site opens at 06:00 - 12:00 each day. I had heard different options for going but on this date 03/02/2023 this is how it went.Arrived at site at 08:00 and was told there was only one Whale Shark and it was unlikely that we could go out. I explained I only had this day and was prepared to wait. So I put my name in the book and I was no. 150. I got to pay for the experience at 10:00 and was on the boat at 10:20. Well worth the wait. There is a sheltered area or sit in the sun.If I had of arrived at 06:00 I would have been back on shore having seen the Whale Sharks at 07:00.It was a wonderful experience. We rented a camera (550 pesos) which we gave to one of the guys on the boat and he did the photography and videoing (100 pesos tip). You can use your camera in a water proof bag if you have one (or can buy onsite).You get into a boat with approximately 10 others, they row you out and using the boats create a constant barrier inside which they feed the sharks to keep them in the zone for us tourists to see up close.If you have an issue with captivity then this is not for you, but for the majority of normal people we can see the real creatures and hope the money spent is well invested to protect and save the WS?ÅEEEEEEEE???ÅEEEEEEEEs.The experience lasted approximately 30 minutes and was a pleasure. Life jackets and masks were included for a fee of 500 pesos, snorkels and flippers could be hired.There were restaurants, souvineer shops and  equipment shops (where I bought water shoes for 400 pesos) at the site.As we are at 11:30 the site was closing.

129,Luzon,Metro Manila,canyoneering,Taal Volcano Eruption Sightseeing and Pagsanjan Falls (2-in-1 Tour from Manila),"Overall I had only 2,5 days in Manila, but I did not want to spend them just by sitting at the hotel swimming pool or viewing concrete jungle. So, I decided to go for this trip - outside the city, closer to nature and, of course, safer if this trip is done by a local. And it was the correct choice! We had our fantastic guide Allan, who took care of us whole journey long. He safely drove us to volcano Taal: first of all to take a look from far, and then closer from the lake side. Our small group chose to go for a 2h boat trip to volcano Taal (and again it was absolutely correct choice, as the volcanic island showed completely different looks from each perspective). I particularly liked a lot to see the local fishermen daily routines, when they take care about their fishing areas, fishing nets etc. The second big journey was to Pagsanjan Waterfalls, and it was even more amazing experience. Jurassic park views, feeling like in the middle of jungle, beauty of nature and the power of river was there! On top of that we were brought by boat and two professional local rowers against the river flow and over the rapids to the waterfalls (it seemed like these two men know each stone under the water by heart). Woooow. Nature is amazing, and so is the main Pagsanjan waterfall. What a wonderful process and experience! So, I definitely recommend this 2-in-1 tour to others, who like nature more than concrete city jungle views.",7771.63,4.5,21,6,https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/AttractionProductReview-g298573-d19758716-Taal_Volcano_Eruption_Sightseeing_and_Pagsanjan_Falls_2_in_1_Tour_from_Manila-Mani.html,Overall 25 days Manila want spend sitting hotel swimming pool viewing concrete jungle decided go trip outside city closer nature course safer trip done local correct choice fantastic guide Allan took care us whole journey long safely drove us volcano Taal first take look far closer lake side small group chose go 2h boat trip volcano Taal absolutely correct choice volcanic island showed completely different looks perspective particularly liked lot see local fishermen daily routines take care fishing areas fishing nets etc second big journey Pagsanjan Waterfalls even amazing experience Jurassic park views feeling like middle jungle beauty nature power river top brought boat two professional local rowers river flow rapids waterfalls seemed like two men know stone water heart Woooow Nature amazing main Pagsanjan waterfall wonderful process experience definitely recommend 2in1 tour others like nature concrete city jungle views,Outdoor Activities

The tour guide Jonas provided fantastic historical background and local knowledge for all the stops, while the dedicated driver JR handled that wild Manila traffic.The stops were as described in the tour, we did a slightly different order, for example first stop was American Cemetery and Memorial in BGC, a beautiful spot honoring American and Philippine war dead.  We were struck by how immaculate the memorial and gardens were and the scale of the names listed for the many thousands who lost their lives.We hit all the spots in Manila - Intramuros, Casa Manila, San Agustin Church.  We breezed past any lineups as we were with our guide Jonas.  Jonas' english was excellent and was keen on providing a real tour guide experience.  We gained knowledge of Philippine history and heroes such as Jose Rizal, as well as the local view of history, politics, and daily life for Filipinos.

138,Visayas,Cebu,boat charters,"Mactan Cebu Island Hopping with Lunch - Gilutungan, Caohagan, Nalusuan","The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because I'm sure there are more premium snorkeling experiences out there (depending on how much experience you have going on snorkeling tours) so if you're one of those people, I wanted to give the proper relative rating...but for anything that was lacking or not up to your standards, Obet and the deckhands (Warren and Julius I believe were their names) made up for it and then some with their level of attentiveness and service.  Here's an example of how attentive the deckhands were...one of them noticed on several occasions that I was either having issues with my mask or that I was lagging behind the others or that I was ready to get back to the boat.  Each time, they were right beside me to even help fix my gear or shuttle me through the water (he had fins).  That made a huge impression on me and is worth gold when it comes to an experience.We can't speak highly enough about Obet.

There was only a trickle of people, even though it was a weekend.  Accordingly, I would advise that you reach there at 10 AM - the big fish would still be there, but the crowds would have gone home by then.
