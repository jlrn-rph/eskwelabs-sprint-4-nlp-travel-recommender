# Sprint 4 Project: Lakbay Mindanao: A Data-Driven Journey Through the Hidden Gems of the South
We are the team **chatgpt4**! We are a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds who came together as part of the Eskwelabs Data Science Cohort 11. In our fourth sprint, we collaborated to create a data-driven presentation on NLP-based recommender engine entitled **Lakbay Mindanao: A Data-Driven Journey Through the Hidden Gems of the South**. 

The project uses data scraped from Klook and TripAdvisor, which is preprocessed by tokenization, lemmatization, and other NLP-based preprocessing techniques. It is wrangled and analyzed using Python Pandas, exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib, and similarity techniques using TF-IDF and spaCy similarity . Recommender engines were also utilized to provide personalized recommendation for potential travel packages in Mindanao.

## Project Deployment

## How to Run Locally
To run the code, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the application using the following command: `streamlit run app.py`.
5. The application will open in your browser.

## Recommendations
For the recommendations, improvements can be further made in improving the system by creating a more comprehensive dataset, optimized performance metrics and exploration of different similarity measures and other ranking approaches. Collaborations with NGOs and local communities can also be done by partnering with them for on-the-ground knowledge, relevant campaigns and dissemination of information regarding tourist venues in Mindanao. Finally, collaboration with travel websites to reach out to hosts in Mindanao to list their tourism packages for wider reach for both the locals' businesses and the websites.
