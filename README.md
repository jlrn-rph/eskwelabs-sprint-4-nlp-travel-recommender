# Sprint 4 Project: Lakbay Mindanao: A Data-Driven Journey Through the Hidden Gems of the South
We are the team **chatgpt4**! We are a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds who came together as part of the Eskwelabs Data Science Cohort 11. In our fourth sprint, we collaborated to create a data-driven presentation on NLP-based recommender engine entitled **Lakbay Mindanao: A Data-Driven Journey Through the Hidden Gems of the South**. 

The project uses data scraped from Klook and TripAdvisor, which is preprocessed by tokenization, lemmatization, and other NLP-based preprocessing techniques. It is wrangled and analyzed using Python Pandas, exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib, and similarity techniques using TF-IDF and spaCy similarity . Recommender engines were also utilized to provide personalized recommendation for potential travel packages in Mindanao.
