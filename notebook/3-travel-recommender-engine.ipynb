TF-IDF Vectorization: If there is no exact activity match, the system preprocesses the destination descriptions and computes TF-IDF vectors for both the user's destination descriptions and the Mindanao destination descriptions.

These word vectors encode semantic similarity, allowing us to measure the similarity between two words or phrases.
